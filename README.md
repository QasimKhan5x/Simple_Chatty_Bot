# Simple_Chatty_Bot
This is the first project I built on Hyperskill.org. It tests Java fundamentals such as variables, I/O, control flow, loops, methods, and modular programming. You can interact with the bot in many ways by typing the required commands into a command line.

Code is present in
Simple Chatty Bot/task/src/bot/SimpleBot.java

The Problems folder contains solutions to a list of problems I solved on hyperskill while learning the fundamentals of Java needed to code this project.
